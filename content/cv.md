<h2>ABOUT</h2>

<p>
My name is Ryan Achten, I am a senior software engineer currently working for the cloud accounting software company, Xero. 
</p>
<p>
Graduating with a Bachelor of Communication Design, I made the move to delve into the world of code and undertake my Masters in Design Innovation. Since then, I have worked as a designer and developer, fulfilling roles from user experience research and design, all the way through to software development and deployment.

<p>
Today, I focus on fullstack development, producing polished digital experiences for a variety of clients and projects, while progressing my interests in related areas such as dev-ops and machine learning.
