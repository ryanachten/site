# SomaVision

SomaVision is a visualiser interface created using Arduino hardware and a PureData patch to create a system that produces a range of visuals for perfomative applications such as music visualisation etc.

The new design looks to rectify past issues with a heavy focus placed on creating a product that is stable enough for performance use without the fear of the software or hardware crashing mid-performance. This means finding ways to reduce CPU strain that the current Pd patches place on the laptop and ensuring that the electrical circuits are designed in such a way that they won't detach when the casing is moved.
