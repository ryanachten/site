Oskelate is a skeleton responsive music visualiser that uses Microsoft's Kinect hardware to facilitate more responsive music visualisations.

Oskelate is a skeleton music visualised built in Pure Data (Pd) and Java. There is two core sets of functionality built into this system: elements which responds to the audio and elements that respond to the performer's skeleton data. By combining these two inputs, Oskelate looks to provide musicians with ability to create a unique visual component to their performance that represents not only the audio qualities of their music but also their kinetic movement on stage. By enabling the visualisation of the musician's performance on stage, the Oskelate system aims to encourage a higher emphasis on visual components within musical performance without the necessity for specialised skillets or software knowledge.
